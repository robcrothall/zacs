				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that some of you have started studying this course seriously, there are some ideas that I would like to share with you&#8230;</p>
<p>Firstly, building on our initial success in Nemato, we are extending this offer of free training to anyone in South Africa!  Anyone who has access to a PC connected to the Internet can do this course and learn to make money by writing programs for corporate Clients and small and medium sized businesses!</p>
<p>We have noticed that some of the students are already taking on work for Clients, even though they are not yet halfway through the course.  There is nothing stopping you from working for paying Clients, but remember that you will be building a reputation at a stage when you are not yet very skilled.  Your first Clients will remember that and will tell other potential Clients that &#8220;you are not very good&#8221;!  Is that the reputation you want to build?  Rather focus on your course, and earn better money once you have the necessary training.</p>
<p>We have added a new article in our &#8220;Links&#8221; menu that tells us about the jobs of the future and what skills you will need to get those jobs &#8211; enjoy!</p>
<p>Remember to send an email to <a href="mailto:zacomputerscience@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">zacomputerscience@googlegroups.com</a> if you have any questions or need some help.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning about computers involves more than just learning to use social media and a few products like a spreadsheet or word processor.  With a little training, you can write programs that companies will pay for.  When you combine that with a little knowledge of Computer Science, you can charge a premium for your work.</p>
<p>There are excellent University courses available in South Africa that will give you a formal qualification, but that will cost a fair bit of money and at least three years.  The courses that we recommend (see our &#8220;Links&#8221; page) are a useful introduction to Computer Science and programming and could take you around fifteen weeks.</p>
<p>You can get started right now by finding a PC that is connected to the Internet and registering for the free courses that we recommend under &#8220;Training&#8221;.  You can find some places that offer computer access under our &#8220;Resources&#8221; page.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t delay!  Start today.</p>
